Crypto needs primitives that reduce Sybil pressure without turning users into dossiers.

Proof of Humanity (Lite) is a minimal human-verification building block:
- no identity claims
- no KYC
- no accounts
- no tracking
- no vendor lock-in

It creates one thing:
**public proof that a human likely performed effort at a moment in time.**

Wallets should be able to gate actions (claims, referrals, campaigns) using proofs that are:
- auditable
- self-hostable
- cheap
- privacy-preserving
